Installation
============
It is recommended to install ELDAmwl within a virtual environment.
E.g., `virtualenv
<https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_.

The file ``Pipfile.lock`` contains the
information on all required packages including
their specific version.

After checking out ELDAmwl from the SCC repository,
you have to change into the ELDAmwl path and run

.. code:: console

    $ cd ELDAmwl
    $ pipenv install

for the installation of ELDAmwl in its virtual environment.

There is also the option (not recommended) to
update your system Python installation according to the
requirements of ELDAmwl using ``setup.py`` which is also
available in the project.
