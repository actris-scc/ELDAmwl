In order to run ELDAmwl you need an instance of the SCC
database.

`Input files <https://scc-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/file_formats/low_resolution.html>`_ of ELDAmwl
are NetCDF files which are generated by
the SCC pre-processing module ELPP.
An example is provided here: ``ELDAmwl/tests/data/20181228oh00_0000379.nc``
