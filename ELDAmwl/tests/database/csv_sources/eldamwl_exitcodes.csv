0,Finished without errors
1,Configuration file not found
2,Lidar ratio file not found
3,Intermediate signal file not found
4,File with Savitzky-Golay coefficients not found
5,Invalid measurement ID
6,Directory for log file not found
7,Use case not yet implemented
8,Product not yet implemented
9,Cannot connect to db
10,Cannot read ncfile
11,Calibration range higher than valid data range
12,Cannot find variable Lidar_Ratio in lr file
13,No valid data points for calibration
14,Cannot create merged signal
15,Cannot average products: profiles have different height axis or vertical resolutions
16,Noise of far-range profile too large for merging
17,Some of the needed options for product calculation were not found in the db. Please check in the products page that all needed values were defined correctly (e.g. product options, monte carlo options, ...).
18,Cannot average signals with different scan angles
19,Cannot create near range or far range extinction profile
20,Iterative bsc calculation does not converge
21,Not enough pre-calculated Savitzky-Golay coefficients
22,Unknown runtime exception
255,Timeout
23,Number of MonteCarlo iterations must be larger than 1
24,Klett bsc retrieval requires Error method = Monte-Carlo; no MC options are provided for the retrieval of Klett bsc
25,no mathematically stable solution of Klett retrieval
254,General error (most probably segmentation fault)
26,no channel_id in nc file -> rerun ELPP
27,negative calibration value, signal might be negative
28,This version of ELDA requires pre-processed files generated with ELPP version 7.00 or larger
29,more than 1 depolarization per product not yet implemented
30,cannot find correct channel idx in pre-processed file
31,detection limit of products must be larger than 0.
32,Wrong SCC version. "re-run ELDA" is not possible because pre-processed files have been generated with a previous SCC version. You need to apply "reprocess all"
33,no dimension "depolarization" in pre-processed file
34,cannot find positive values in profile
41,wrong command line parameter
42,different cloud masks exist for measurement
43,different header information in ELPP files of measurement
44,calibration params of backscatter products of the measurement are not equal
45,No MonteCarlo Options for product
46,No backscatter calibration options for product
47,could not find overlap file in database
48,could not find calibration window for backscatter retrieval
100,internal error: cannot fnd requested information in data storage
101,internal error: more than 1 override to class registry
