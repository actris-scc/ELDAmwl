ELDAmwl is a Python software for retrieving vertical profiles of optical aerosol properties at multiple wavelengths
from lidar measurements. It is one module of the Single Calculus Chain (SCC)
[`D'Amico et. al. (2015) <https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/8/4891/2015/>`_] .
ELDAmwl reads pre-processed lidar signals [`D'Amico et. al. (2016) <https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/9/491/2016/>`_],
derives particle backscatter and extinction coefficients, volume and particle linear depolarization ratios,
lidar ratios and Angstr√∂m exponents.
It is an enhancement of the EARLINET Lidar Data Analyzer ELDA
[`Mattis et al. (2016) <https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/9/3009/2016/>`_] which makes synergistic use of the
multiwavelength information of the lidar data.
